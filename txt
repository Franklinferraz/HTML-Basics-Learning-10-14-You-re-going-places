You're going places!
What if you wanted to send the user to another part of your website, or another website altogether? 
You use hyperlinks, or links for short!

<a href="http://www.codecademy.com">My Favorite Site!</a>
First, there's an opening <a> tag and that tag has an attribute called href. The href value tells your link where you want it to go, in this case http://www.codecademy.com.
Then you have a description of your link between your opening <a> and your closing </a> tags. This is what you will be able to click on.
Finally, you have your closing </a> tag.
Instructions
In the body section, create a link. To do this, create an <a> tag. Point your link to a website by setting the value of the href attribute
Add a description of your link
Close the element with a closing tag </a>

Mid-lesson breather
You've done an awesome job! Here's a quick summary of things we've learned:

HTML is used to give websites structure.
We open HTML files using a browser, and the browser renders (shows us) the file.
HTML files have a <head> and a <body> (just like you!)
In the head, we have the <title> tags, and we use these to specify the webpage's name.
How to make headings and paragraphs.
Instructions
Add a title between the <title> tags.
Create a <h3> sized heading in the body. 
Make your heading say anything you want! 
(Just don't forget to close it.)
Create three paragraphs using <p> tags and fill them with content 
(e.g. about cars, your pet, favorite city to travelâ€”whatever you like!)
